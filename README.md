## About me: 
- My name is Kathleen (she/her) I am a career changer who was formerly a food scientist and later attended coding bootcamp to become a software engineer based in the US.
- My experience is working in front end development creating responsive web applications and user friendly UIs using modern Javascript frameworks such as React and Angular.
- I'm currently looking for software engineering positions working in the front end, but am also looking to expand my domain by working full stack and back end as well.
- Right now I am working on some projects and playing around with some back end languages/frameworks such as NestJS.
- Outside of coding I am a competitive powerlifter, love attending anime/pop-culture conventions and love video games!
